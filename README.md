<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In this project, the invoices of a purchasing specialist 
for the purchased products were recorded in the accounting system.

Project Description:
* The new invoice information to be entered into the accounting system is not approved if the sum of all approved invoices 
entered by that purchasing specialist so far exceeds the specified limit, and approved if it does not exceed the limit.
* The limit is the same for all purchasing professionals during the process period.
* Each purchasing specialist is uniquely identified by the trio of Name, Surname and E-mail.
* Transactions of people with the same name and surname but different email addresses are evaluated separately.

### Built With

* [Java](https://www.java.com/tr/)
* [Spring](https://spring.io/)
